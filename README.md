# Solving Problems with Data Structures and Algorithms

Real world applications to common data structures and algorithms

## Stack

- [ ] __Backtracking__ problems to remember paths visited and undo actions. E.g Creating a _custom back button_ to a web application.
- [ ] Building a __programming language parser__.
- [ ] Creating a __base converter algorithm__. E.g _converting a decimal number to binary_.
- [ ] Creating a [palindrome checker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

## Queue

- [ ] Store a list of undo operations using a __dequeue__ (_This is a double ended queue tha allows one to insert and remove elements from the end or front of the queue_).
- [ ] Check if a word is a palindrome.
- [ ] Simulate the [hot potato game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_potato).
- [ ] Opening a new tab in a browser.
- [ ] CPU scheduling.
- [ ] Disk scheduling.
- [ ] Asynchronous data transfer. E.g IO buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
